= Overview

This project provides a framework for building a https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] project to quickly implement a https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/overview.html[service broker] for https://www.cloudfoundry.org[Cloud Foundry].

This project replaces https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/spring-boot-cf-service-broker[Spring Boot CF Service Broker]. 

== Compatibility

* https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html[Service Broker API]: 2.13

== Getting Started

See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application[Spring Boot documentation] for getting started building a Spring Boot application.

A sample https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-service-broker[MongoDB service broker] project is available.

Add dependencies to your project's build file. 

Maven example: 

    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-service-broker</artifactId>
            <version>${springCloudServiceBrokerVersion}</version>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-service-broker</artifactId>
            <version>${springCloudServiceBrokerVersion}</version>
            <classifier>tests</classifier>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>

Gradle example: 

    dependencies {
        ...
        compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-service-broker:${springCloudServiceBrokerVersion}")
        testCompile(group: "org.springframework.cloud", name: "spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-service-broker", version: "${springCloudServiceBrokerVersion}", classifier: "tests")
        ...
    }        

== Configuring the broker

The framework provides default implementations of most of the components needed to implement a service broker. In Spring Boot fashion, you can override the default behavior by providing your own implementation of Spring beans, and the framework will back away from its defaults.

To start, use the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` or `@SpringBootApplication` annotation on the broker's main application class:

    @ComponentScan
    @EnableAutoConfiguration
    public class Application {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
        }
    }

This will trigger the inclusion of the default configuration.

=== Service beans

The Cloud Foundry service broker API has three main endpoint groupings: catalog management, service instance provisioning/deprovisioning, and service instance binding/unbinding. The broker will need to provide one Spring bean to provide the necessary functionality for each endpoint grouping.

For catalog management, the framework provides a default implementation that requires the broker to just provide an implementation of a link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/servicebroker/model/Catalog.java[`Catalog` bean]. There is an example of this approach in the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-service-broker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/servicebroker/mongodb/config/CatalogConfig.java[MongoDB sample broker]. To override this default, provide your own bean that implements the link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/servicebroker/service/CatalogService.java[`CatalogService`] interface.

For service instance provisioning/deprovisioning, provide a Spring bean that implements the link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/servicebroker/service/ServiceInstanceService.java[`ServiceInstanceService`] interface. There is no default implementation provided.

For service instance binding/unbinding, provide a Spring bean that implements the link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/servicebroker/service/ServiceInstanceBindingService.java[`ServiceInstanceBindingService`] interface. If the service broker does not provide any bindable services, this bean can be omitted and a default implementation will be provided.

=== Security

The project includes the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-security[`spring-boot-starter-security`] project.  See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security[Spring Boot Security documentation] for configuration options.

The default behavior creates a user called `user` with a generated password that is logged as an `INFO` message during app startup.  For example:

    2014-04-16T10:08:52.54-0600 [App/0]   OUT Using default password for application endpoints: 7c2969c1-d9c7-47e9-9c9e-2cd94a7b6cf1

If you are deploying your service broker to Cloud Foundry as an app, be aware the password is re-generated every time you push the application.  Therefore, you need to run `cf update-service-broker` with the new password after each push.

To see the generated password in the application logs on Cloud Foundry, use one of the following commands:

    $ cf logs <broker-app-name>
    $ cf logs --recent <broker-app-name>

=== API version verification

By default, the framework will verify the version of the service broker API for each request it receives. To disable service broker API version header verification, provide a `BrokerApiVersion` bean that accepts any API version:

    @Bean
    public BrokerApiVersion brokerApiVersion() {
        return new BrokerApiVersion();
    }

== Deploying your broker

Follow the https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html[documentation] to register the broker to Cloud Foundry.

=== Build

The project is built with Gradle. The https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle wrapper] allows you to build the project on multiple platforms and even if you do not have Gradle installed; run it in place of the `gradle` command (as `./gradlew`) from the root of the main project directory.

=== To compile the project and run tests

    ./gradlew build

== Contributing

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/code-of-conduct.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-dependencies-parent/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).
