== Service Broker Security

Authentication and authorization of service broker endpoints is not specified in the Open Service Broker API specification, but some platforms require or let https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[basic authentication] or https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth2] credentials be provided when a service broker is registered to the platform.

The Spring Cloud Open Service Broker project does not implement any security configuration.
Service broker application endpoints can be secured with https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[Spring Security]
and https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-security.html[Spring Boot security configuration]
by applying security to application endpoints with the path-matching pattern: `/v2/**`.

=== Example Configuration

The following examps shows a security configuration implementation:
